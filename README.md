# Aviation Safety Data Analysis
This project analyzes aviation incident data to support safe business decisions in the aviation industry. The analysis focuses on understanding patterns in injury rates, aircraft types, build quality, and purpose of flight.

## Project Objective
To help a company entering the aviation sector make informed, data-driven decisions by identifying:
- Safer aircraft manufacturers
- Risk levels by aircraft category
- High-risk flight purposes
- Impact of build type (professional vs. amateur)

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Tableau (for visualization)
- Git & GitHub

## Files Included
- `cleaned_AviationData.csv` – Cleaned dataset
- `Untitled.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with full analysis
- Tableau Public Link – https://public.tableau.com/views/Aviation_17513554587720/SeverityFrequencyofAircraftIncidents?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link

## Key Insights
- Professionally-built aircraft (especially Boeing and Bellanca) have lower average injury rates.
- Amateur-built aircraft show higher risk across most manufacturers.
- Helicopters and instructional flights are linked to higher injury rates.

## Recommendations
- Invest in professionally-built aircraft from proven manufacturers.
- Avoid or vet amateur-built aircraft.
- Focus on airplane categories for safer operations.
